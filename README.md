# A Brief Project Description

## View Live Website: [YelpCamp](https://blooming-island-18961.herokuapp.com/)

YelpCamp is the final project for Colt's Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp. This course is a complete web developer course that covers all aspects of web development from front end to back end, and everything in between. This is a full stack application that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.Js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB. Node packages were installed to increase functionality and improve user experience. 

YelpCamp allows a user to view different campsights around the country. Authentication middleware is used to allow users to set up a login. Logging in allows you the ability to add new campgrounds. You can then edit and delete campgrounds that you've entered. You can also leave reviews on campsights other users have set up.
